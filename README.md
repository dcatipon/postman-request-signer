## How It Works

This 'Pre-request Script' generates a verification hash that is used to sign requests. It is created from a public/private key pair, timestamp, endpoint, and parameter string using SHA512.

## Requirements / Setup

Requests must include:
- **key** - The public key.
- **time** - The Unix timestamp. Set to **time** environment variable.
- **verification** - The hash generated by this plugin. Set to **verification** environment variable.

Environment variables must include:
- **base_url** - Base url without endpoint.
- **private_key** - Your private key.
- **time** - Script will set this value. This is necessary to ensure that the timestamp used is identical for hash generation and the time parameter in the request. Alternatively, this value can be manually set as well as long as the value is valid and not 'expired'.
- **verification** - Script will set this value.
